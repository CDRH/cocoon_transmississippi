<h2>Memorabilia</h2>
    <p>The materials and documents collected here offer insights into the preparation and planning of the Expo, and demonstrate the managers’ efforts to reach out to community members and organizations. The documents also indicate the impact of domestic and global conflicts—from the investigation of the business conduct of the Expo’s president, Gurdon W. Wattles, to the Spanish-American War. Other materials suggest the daily maintenance of the Expo—programs, passes, menus, and Midway exhibit tickets—while offering a glimpse into the graphic design of the day, and various other aspects of visual culture. </p>
